## Administration
	* Divide into two groups for the course
		* Group 1 goes to the Pelkmans Lab first
		* Group 2 goes to the Brunner Lab first:
			* Group 2 is divided into sub-groups Fly & Yeast

## Learning Objectives

	* At the end of the day, you will be able to:
		1. Understand the use-case for TissueMaps
		2. Use TissueMaps to process your image data
		3. Process single cell measurements using python
		4. Create plots of your data using python

## What Will We Do Today?

	*  9:20 - 10:00	Upload data to TissueMaps
	                  & start processing it
	* 10:20 - 11:30	Image processing &
	                cell segmentation in TissueMaps
	* 12:30 - 13:15	Using machine learning & downloading data
	* 13:30 - 14:00	Intro to Python
	* 14:00 - 14:45	Data processing
	* 14:45 - 15:00	Discussing data processing
	* 15:15 - 16:00	Plotting data
	* 16:00 - 16:30	Discussing plotting & wrap up

## Motivation for Doing Image Analysis

## What is TissueMaps
	* Cloud platform for image viewing & analysis
	* Scalable & interactive
	* Accessible by web browser

## Your Jupyter Notebook & TissueMaps Server
	* Get one sheet with instructions &
	  passwords per 2 people
